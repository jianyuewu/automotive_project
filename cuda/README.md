# CUDA basics  
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture).  
GPGPU (General Purpose computing in GPU).  

# env setup  
1. Install cuda  
Download from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads  
In ubuntu, use run file has less steps.  
```bash
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.5.0/local_installers/cuda_12.5.0_555.42.02_linux.run  
sudo sh cuda_12.5.0_555.42.02_linux.run  
```
Or directly with apt install:  
```bash
apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit  
```

# colab cuda usage  
We can also run cuda in colab, which is very convenient when we need just run some small cuda tests.
