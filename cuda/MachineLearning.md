# Machine learning basics
Neural networks -> Deep learning -> Machine learning -> AI.
1. Generate model from input(i.e. training dataset).
2. Investigate and solve problems on new datasets.

# Types
Supervised learning: Regression, Classification. => Labels input.  
Unsupervised learning: Clustering, Dimensional Reduction. => Unlabeled data without human interference.  
Semi-Supervised Learning.  
Reinforcement Learning.  

# Flow
Get data -> Preprocess Data -> Train Model -> Test Data -> Improve  
Data quality is very important.  
There are some tools like Pandas, Matplotlib can be used for data visualization, so data can be checked in each step by us.

# Algorithms
Regression: Linear regression(straight line), Decision tree(branches), Random Forest(multiple decision trees).  
Classification: Logistic Regression(Probability+Sigmoid), Stochastic Gradient Descent(gradient descent+stochastic), K-Nearest Neighbours(K).  

# Training
Split data to training set and testing set.  
Hyper-Param tuning.  
Evaluate, i.e. R2 Score/Mean Squared Error/Mean Abosolute Error, Accuracy/Precision/Recall.
